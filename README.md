# About

This project is a [tutorial by Alex the Analyst](https://youtu.be/opJgMj1IUrc) for working with Excel. The data are of bicycle sales at some company (Alex doesn't discuss the origin of the data). Some of the things Alex performs in the tutorial are not possible with the free version of Excel on Office 365 but may be possible with Google Sheets. Although I did the bulk of this work in [Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RJjrcDdxwlNLZv71IURbeW3_dehkFt3p/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110360102737025175521&rtpof=true&sd=true), I have yet to learn how to make an interactive dashboard with that software. I will update this project as I learn more.

## Skills Practiced

### Pivot Tables

This project included several pivot tables I used to compare multiple variables in the data. I am becoming much more comfortable using pivot tables thanks to the work done.

### Charting

I used a couple of new charts in this project: stacked bar and stacked column charts. Though I still don't really *like* these types of charts, as I find them a bit cluttered, I do see their utility in displaying certain data.

## What I Found Interesting

While working through the tutorial with Alex, I noticed that bike sales generally dropped as the buyer's commute increased (from 0-10+ miles), but there was a slight increase in sales for commutes of 2-5 miles. Comparing commutes with several factors such as income and car ownership led me to the conclusion that sales to commuters of 0-1 miles were most likely out of necessity due to insufficient funds to purchase other transportation while sales to farther commuters was more likely to be for enjoyment. Those commuting 2-5 miles, however, seem to be in the income bracket in which they can choose to commute by bike as opposed to those who have only 1-2 miles to ride. The decline in sales to these middle-distance commuters seems to be caused more by an assumed lack of time to choose bicycle commuting.
