# About

This project is a tutorial by Alex the Analyst for working with Excel. The data are of bicycle sales at some company (Alex doesn't discuss the origin of the data). Some of the things Alex performs in the tutorial are not possible with the free version of Excel on Office 365 but may be possible with Google Sheets. Although I did the bulk of this work in Sheets, I have yet to learn how to make an interactive dashboard with that software. I will update this project as I learn more.

## Skills Practiced

### Pivot Tables

This project included several pivot tables I used to compare multiple variables in the data. I am becoming much more comfortable using pivot tables thanks to the work done.
